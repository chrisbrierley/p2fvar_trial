# p2fvar_trial
This is a testing directory to past 2 future variabilty stuff with the pangeo binder. 

At present, it doesn't really work and relies on data stored in a predetermined location attached to the hardware/within the repository. 

The data files are created by Chris Brierley (@chrisbrierley) as part of the PMIP's [Past2Future](www.past2future.org]) initiative. They use NCAR's [Climate Variability Diagnostics Package](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/CVC/cvdp) to process the CMIP/PMIP model output.

There are some tables of climate mode changes and IPCC AR5 Region values stored in the repository. This are mainly to be used for scatterplots.

The intention is that the rest of the data will be distributed on a small [ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html) server (run by @chrisbrierley on Amazon Web Services). I've not found the time to create this yet :weary:

You can run this repository on a Pangeo Binder, but be aware that may take 30mins to load everythign up to be ready to use
